        <h3 class="heading-interacting">Interacting With People</h3>
        <p>But my best skill is actually in interacting with different culture and people.
          and also Give them a chance to talk, don't say or do anything insulting, respect their differences,
          and generally treat them the way that you would want to be treated. Listen.
          The most important part of interacting well with others is to listen to them.
